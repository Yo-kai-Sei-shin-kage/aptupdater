# APTUP

# By Yokai Seishinkage with contributions from "deadhead420"

A slim and simple tool to make updating and upgrading with apt-get faster and easier. This is a root-only tool since apt-get 
requires that you be root in order to execute. Aptup will keep a date and time record of your past updates, upgrades, and 
your dist-upgrades in a log file created specifically for aptup. Aptup is a user-interactive tool and it will keep 
your update records as long as you wish to have them.
