# APTUPDATER

# By Yokai Seishinkage

A slim and simple tool to make updating and upgrading with apt-get faster and easier. This is a root-only tool since apt-get requires that you be root in order to execute. Aptupdater will keep a date and time record of your past updates, upgrades, and your dist-upgrades in a log file created specifically for aptupdater. Aptupdater is a user-interactive tool and it will keep your update records as long as you wish to have them.
